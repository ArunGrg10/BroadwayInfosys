# like in other programming languages, python also has its own data-types.
# 1. Numbers = immutable
# 2. Boolen += immutale
# 3. List = mutable
# 4. Tuple = immutable
# 5. String =immutable
# 6. Dictionary =mutable

##### multiple and immutable objects####
# If an object once created can be altered inits life period then it is mutable data-type.
# eg. of mutable are list dictionary and set
# But if an object once created can never be altered then it is immutable object
