# We may have different projects in our systems that may require different package dependencies.
# your project 1 may have pandas version 2.1 whereas project 2 may have pandas version 2.5 n the same system
# So, this arises a problem. If you want to work on project 1 then one of packages must be uninstalled form
# your global system and another version should be installed.

# This problem cab be solved creating a virtual environments in your system
# Virtual Environment is an isolated environment to keep the packages required for your project.
# It solves the problem of installing and uninstalling packages for different projects in a same system.

# Every python project must be done  with a virtual environment activated


# Commands for Virtual Environment
1. python -n venv <environment_name>
    => This command creates a new virtual environment (for this session lets say "venv")

2. venv\Scripts\activate (for windows device enter this command in command prompt)
   source venv\bin\activate (for mac and linux devices)
   => This command activates teh virtual environment

3. Deactivate
   => This deactivates virtual environment

4. pip freeze
   => IT displays all the packages installed in the environment

5. pip freeze > requirements.txt
   => Add all the dependenies fo the project in requirements.txt file

6. pip install -r requirements.txt
   => Recursively installs al the packages in teh virtual environment
