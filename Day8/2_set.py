# Set in python are mutable datatype. However, every elements of a set
# must be immutable
# Set doesn't support indexing and slicing
# Set elements are always unique
# Set are unordered. {1,3} and {3,1} are same

# Creating an empty set
a= set()

# a={} # This is not an empty set. It's an empty dictionary

# Creating non-empty set
data = {1, 2, 3, 4}
fruits = {"ammple", "mango", "banana"}
a = {2, "as", (3, 5)}
print(a)
a= {[2,3], 3}  # This is not a valid set. It raises error.
